# README for tpnames AppEngine
# Jeff Miller, 15-July-2008

To try out the name generator by itself, run:

     python names.py < starwars.txt

To launch this Google AppEngine web application using the AppEngine
development environment, install AppEngine (code.google.com/appengine ;
requires Python 2.5), then run the development application server
which will launch the application on Port 8080.

This example command line assumes that the AppEngine scripts are on
your path, and that the current working directory is the parent
directory of the "tpnames" web application directory.

      dev_appserver.py tpnames/

If run without arguments, dev_appserver.py will print out a usage 
message listing possible options like --port=HTTP_PORT 

A version of this has been installed on the AppEngine vhost:
