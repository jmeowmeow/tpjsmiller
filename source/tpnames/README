# README for Thousand Parsec name generator core
# Jeff Miller, 26-July-2008

To try out the name generator, run:

     python names.py < starwars.txt

or any of the other name data text files.

The name data files have a simple format of one model name per line,
with syllables separated by spaces, and #comment lines.
